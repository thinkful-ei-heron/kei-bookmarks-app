# bookmarks_app

This is a bookmarks app that allows you to save and edit your bookmarks.

A bookmark consists of a title, the URL, a user description, and a rating between 1 and 5 stars. All inputs are required. 

Users can add bookmarks, see a list of their bookmarks when they open the app, click on bookmarks to see an expanded view, delete bookmarks, and edit bookmarks. 

The app stores data in a Thinkful API but renders through the store, following a REACTful design pattern. The state of the store is changed, and based on that the contents of the html are re-rendered. 

The app should scale well between viewports of greater than 320px wide. At greater than 768px (i.e. the width of an iPad), the app will stop expanding in width. 

Future additions involve adding a back button to the "add bookmark" view.
